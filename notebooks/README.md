# Notebooks for the introduction into Molecular Dynamics simulation software.

This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks/Google collab documents, that help to get started with molecular dynamics simulations.

There are currently 3 notebooks intended for the course.
Open them in order to walk through the examples simulations as intended.

If you are interested in how the simulation environement has been set up, we also have a notebooks, taht can set up the environment.
Note, that you won't have permissions to upload the final results into Google drive though.

## Block analysis

There is also an example for block analysis:
